# ft_containers
It's a project from school 42 that demands you to recreate the following stl containers: stack, vector, map and set.
Both map and set use a red black tree. Iterator systems are implemented for the appropriate containers.

## Testing
Tests are provided in the form of a main.cpp file, including comparison of output and performance/timing with the corresponding STL containers.
